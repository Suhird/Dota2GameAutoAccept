# Dota2GameAutoAccept
Dota 2 is a 5v5 multiplayer online battle arena game created by Valve. When all 10 players are ready and a game is found, the client pops up a window to accept the game. This window remains for 15 secs. If the player does not accepts the game, he is banned from matchmaking for sometime which can be frustrating because you were in bathroom or opening door for someone situation. 
This tool auto accepts the game for you when that window pops up.
Written in Python 2.8 and OpenCV, this tool automates clicking of accept button by doing image detection.
